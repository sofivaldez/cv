        <p class="about-me">
            I am 24 years old and have a passion for sports, languages, music, reading, and continuously learning new things. In September 2022, I completed a web development bootcamp at Hack Academy. Since then, I've been working at a software development company that provides solutions for Netsuite SuiteCommerce. I am also committed to ongoing self-education to enhance my skills.
            <br/>
            My role encompasses a wide range of responsibilities within the development team. I collaborate on software projects, participating in tasks such as coding, debugging, testing, and documentation. Additionally, I contribute to solving technical issues and continually learn new technologies to enhance my skills and support the company's objectives. My primary focus is on learning and growing in the field of programming while working as part of a team to deliver quality solutions.
